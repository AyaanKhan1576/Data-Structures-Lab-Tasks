# Data Structures Lab Assignments

This repository contains C++ implementations and documentation for various data structures and algorithms, organized by weekly lab assignments for a university-level Data Structures course.

## Structure
Each folder (`Lab01`, `Lab02`, ..., `Lab13`) corresponds to a specific lab session. Inside each folder, you will find:
- **C++ Source Files**: Implementations of data structures and solutions to lab tasks (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs).
- **Word Documents**: Lab reports or assignment write-ups.

## Labs Overview
- **Lab01**: Array manipulation and duplicate removal.
- **Lab02**: Singly linked lists and related operations.
- **Lab03**: Stack implementations (array-based and linked list-based) and decimal-to-binary conversion.
- **Lab04**: Doubly linked lists and advanced list operations.
- **Lab05**: Queue implementations (array-based and linked list-based).
- **Lab06**: Circular linked lists and Josephus problem.
- **Lab07**: Binary trees and traversal algorithms.
- **Lab09**: Binary search trees (BST) and node property queries.
- **Lab10**: AVL trees, balancing, and tree joining.
- **Lab11**: Hash tables (linear probing, chaining) and student record management.
- **Lab12**: Hash maps with quadratic probing and open addressing.
- **Lab13**: Graph representations (adjacency matrix and list), and algorithms like Dijkstra's and Prim's.

## How to Use
1. Open the desired lab folder.
2. Compile the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
3. Run the executables to test the implementations.
4. Refer to the `.docx` files for explanations, results, and lab-specific instructions.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Windows OS (tested)
